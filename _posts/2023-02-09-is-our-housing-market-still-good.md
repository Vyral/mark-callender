What’s happening in our local market? I’ll share some numbers with you from last August, so you can understand what’s happening in our local area.&nbsp;

In general, it’s actually good news. When I talk to buyers and sellers, they think they've missed the boat somehow. We're not getting multiple offers as much as we were, but the numbers are still showing that homes are increasing in value. **If you’d like to know more, I’ll share a PDF with you** that goes into more detail about our 13-county metro area as of August 2022. Just email me, and I’ll send you a copy.

**{% include pullquote.html %}**

From July 2021 to July 2022, home prices increased by about 5% in value. Keep in mind that this is an average. Meanwhile, our average price is $432,456**. In general, the market started shifting back in June, but our area is still healthy.**

However, from August 2021 to August 2022, prices decreased by 2.4%. However, we are still seeing multiple offer situations, and homes in good condition are selling far over their list prices.

Let me know if you’d like to see that PDF with more detailed information. Just call or email me with any questions. I’d love to help.
