This market is tough enough for buyers as it is; if you make common mistakes during the process, it will become even harder. For example, many people who buy and sell at the same time overvalue their previous home. They are emotionally attached to their old property, and this makes them think it’s worth more than it is. Then, they look at homes out of their price range and set themselves up for disappointment. I have four common mistakes to cover today that you shouldn't make.

First, whether you’re a first-time buyer or a seasoned veteran, I recommend you **don’t underbid on your dream home.** This is a seller’s market; if you give someone a lowball offer, they might not even bother sending a counteroffer.&nbsp;

Second, **don’t waive your home inspection.** I recently saw that 40% to 50% of buyers were waiving their inspections, but I can’t recommend it. This is a complicated topic, so if you want more details on inspections, please reach out, and I’d be happy to go over them with you.&nbsp;

Third, **be upfront with your agent about your needs.** You’re never going to find everything you want in a home, so separate your wants from your needs, and let your agent help you.&nbsp;

Last, **make sure you hire an agent that you trust to get you a great deal.** If you hire an agent who is new to the business just because they’re a family member or friend, it could end up biting you later.&nbsp;
