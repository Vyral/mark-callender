In this extremely low-inventory market that we’re in, a lot of people are asking me, “Why should I buy instead of rent?”

I’ve heard this question a lot in my 19 years in real estate. One client who asked me that question 10 years ago still hasn’t made a home purchase. **If they had, they would be in a fantastic place right now. Let me explain.**

According to CoreLogic:&nbsp;

* Roughly 38% of all homes are mortgage-free right now.&nbsp;
* The average equity gain of mortgaged homes in just the last year is $26,300. You won’t be able to find that kind of return anywhere else right now.
* The average equity of mortgaged homes right now is greater than $200,000.
* There was a 16.9% increase in total homeowner equity last year alone.&nbsp;
* Total homeowner equity reached over $1.5 trillion in the United States.

**These numbers are for the national market, and every local market is different.** If you want to get the stats for our local Minneapolis market or you have any questions about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out. I would love to hear from you.
