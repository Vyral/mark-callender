With all the natural disasters happening in our country, insurance companies are being stricter. Right now, they are closely examining insurance papers or insurance binders for buyers.

**Here’s the problem:** many insurance companies are refusing to insure roofs that are ten years old or older. From my point of view, it’s a bit ridiculous. Why not just bring in an inspector to check if the roof is in good shape? If you’ve paid for a 30-year roof, there shouldn’t be a problem if it’s still in great condition, right?

Not every insurance company is doing this, but the major ones are. So, **if you’re selling a home with an older roof, it’s smart to get it checked by an inspector first to assess your roof’s condition.** You can also ask your insurance company to take a look and let them know you plan to sell.

**Why does this matter?** Buyers need proof of insurance or an insurance binder from their insurance company before closing on a home. If they can't get that insurance, it could delay the closing, or worse, they might not be able to close at all. This has happened with many buyers and sellers in the past few months, and it’s a serious issue.
