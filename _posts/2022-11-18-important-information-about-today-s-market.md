Do you want to sell your home but are unsure about timing? This is a very confusing time in the market, but you are not alone. To help sellers like you, I’m answering the three most common questions I have been getting from sellers this winter:

**1\. Should I sell my home in the winter, and if so, when?** I say the sooner the better because you want to get into the market while other sellers are taking their homes off for the holidays. Believe it or not, it is still a seller's market. The craziness has dropped off recently, but that just makes pricing more important than ever.

**2\. Are buyers still out there?** Yes, and your very serious buyers are going to be looking at homes throughout the holidays. Also, 43% of the millennials are looking for homes, and that's the biggest group that is wanting to become a homeowner right now. The millennials, at one point not too long ago, were the renter group, and they didn't want to buy homes. However, when interest rates dropped and there was a shortage of homes, they jumped in. They're a very smart group.

**3\. Can I afford to buy my next home if I sell now?** Chances are you have a lot of equity built up. If you’ve owned your home for five to 10 years, you probably have a ton of equity you're not even aware of. Also, home prices are still rising. They’re rising slowly, but they’ll go up faster again.

The bottom line is that if you are thinking about selling, give me a call. Let's talk it through and see how much equity you have in your house. My team and I can run some numbers and give you the best and most transparent answer. Call or email anytime; we’d love to meet with you.
