As a real estate agent, one of the most common questions I get from home sellers is, *“When is the best time to sell my home?”* While the best time to sell ultimately depends on when you need to move, there are certain times of year that offer distinct advantages. If you're aiming to time the market, selling in late winter or early spring gives you the best chance to avoid heavy competition. Once spring fully hits, inventory increases quickly, meaning you’ll be competing with many more homeowners. If you want to take advantage of the optimal selling window, here are three key things to keep in mind:

**Plan early.** Starting early is crucial. Getting your home ready for the market often involves more work than you might initially think. From staging to repairs, the preparation process can take time. I recommend starting your planning as early as January so you’re ready to list in February or March. This gives you ample time to work with your agent and take the necessary steps without feeling rushed. The earlier you start, the more prepared you’ll be for a successful sale.

**Budget your time.** Unlike the fast-paced pandemic market, homes now take longer to sell. It can take 60 to 120 days from listing to closing, so it’s important to plan your time carefully. Work with your agent to determine your timeline for listing your home, keeping in mind that the market may be slower than what you might expect. Setting a clear schedule will help you manage expectations and align your goals with the market’s current dynamics.

**Beat your competition to the market.** If you have the flexibility, listing early is key. The market starts heating up in early February, and it’s often better to list ahead of the competition rather than wait for the demand to rise. As more homes enter the market later in the spring, you’ll face increased competition, which can make it harder to get the best deal. By listing early, you have the advantage of fewer homes on the market, allowing you to stand out and attract more potential buyers.

If you’re planning to sell this spring and want to ensure you’re getting the best deal possible, the first step is to schedule a pre-listing consultation.
