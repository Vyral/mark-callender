<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s a special holiday message of appreciation just for you.</em></p>

Today I’m reaching out to simply express my gratitude for all of you—my friends, family, and clients—for supporting the Callender Home Team by sending in your referrals. <b>I can't thank you enough for making our success possible</b> amid such trying circumstances. 2020 has been a uniquely challenging year, but now is the time to count our blessings, celebrate our loved ones, and hope that next year bears a better fortune for us all. From the bottom of my heart, I wish you a merry Christmas and a wonderful new year! Stay safe, and enjoy yourself this holiday season.&nbsp;

Should you have any real estate needs or questions before year’s end, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send an email. I’m here to help and would love to hear from you!
