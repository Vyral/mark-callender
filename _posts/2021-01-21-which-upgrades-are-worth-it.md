Which home upgrades are worth the money and will get a great return?

A few posts back, I mentioned that paint and flooring will get you the biggest return on your investment. Today I’ll share a few more tips that will ensure your home improvements will make money for you:

1. **Neutralize your color palette.** Take any bold and unique wall colors and neutralize them.
2. **Boost your curb appeal.** Curb appeal refers to the exterior of your home—the first thing that people will see when they drive by. Boosting curb appeal could mean repainting or restaining the front door, trimming the trees, and clearing up shrubbery. It’s also good to neutralize any unique colors on the outside of your home.
3. **Focus on the flooring and kitchen.** Upgrades here could include replacing old carpet to give your home a fresh look or possibly putting in luxury vinyl plank, which is a very nice-looking laminate. We also have some great connections if you need help with projects like repainting kitchen cabinets, updating hardware, and more.
4. **Let the natural light in.** Also, make sure that all your light bulbs match and shed a warm light that isn’t too bright. If you have any solar screens on your windows, remember to take those off to let the light in, and clean the windows.

These are just a few of the things we recommend to help you get your home ready for the market. If you’d like more suggestions or have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.
