Here’s why I have to “sell” your home twice in today’s market.

{% include pullquote.html %}

What do I mean when I say that I have to “sell your home twice?” Well, when we price and list a home for sale, our seller clients often think (understandably so) that we’re only trying to persuade buyers. In reality, we have come up with the right price for their property and then “sell” the appraiser and lender on that price. Of course, the appraiser isn’t actually buying the home, but they’re the person who will have to report back to the buyer’s lender that the home is at value. If the appraisal comes in too low, your top-dollar sale could be put in jeopardy.&nbsp;

Of course, **our job is to help you sell your home for top dollar as quickly as possible and with the least amount of hassle involved.** However, it does you know good if we get you under contract with a buyer for $70,000 over asking price if we know that an appraiser would never let that fly. Therefore, we have to take more into consideration when pricing your home—we have to think like an appraiser. That means we have to look at the recent sales of nearby (or similarly located) homes that have comparable styles, conditions, and dates of construction.&nbsp;

**For some sellers, squaring the market value of their home with its appraised value can be a reality check.** While most are pretty realistic about their home’s value, there are those who will feel that theirs is the best home on the block… even when all evidence indicates otherwise. Pricing a home above value can be a disaster in the long run. The most self-assured sellers can be humbled by the market’s reaction; how will they feel when their home sits on the market for months on end with zero offers to show for it? Even if they do get an offer for well above what it *should* sell for, they’ll be slammed with a messy low appraisal situation that could result in their buyer running for the hills.&nbsp;

If you have questions about how to properly price your home in today’s market or want some pointers on how to add value to it, please call me. I’d love to hear about your specific situation and talk you through the options that would make the most sense for you. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
