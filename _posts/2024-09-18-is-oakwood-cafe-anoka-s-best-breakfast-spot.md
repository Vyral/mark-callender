[**<u>The Oakwood Cafe</u>**](https://www.facebook.com/oakwoodcafeanoka/) was great when it opened, but it’s even better than I remember. It opened last year in the historic co-op building and offers a unique dining experience focusing on breakfast and lunch. Now, they have many new items for sale, including more selection of baked goods, breakfast sandwiches, and coffee.

It has become my favorite breakfast spot in Anoka. I came here a few weeks ago and had an herb breakfast sandwich, which was one of the best breakfast sandwiches I’ve tasted in the neighborhood. Today, I stopped in for their herb sausage and a breakfast sandwich made with egg, cheddar cheese, and a fresh herb biscuit.

When you walk into Oakwood Cafe, you'll be surprised by the colorful and fragrant flowers that will greet you. This is because they share a space with Main Floral, a charming flower shop in Anoka that I will feature soon. In the meantime, I'll be enjoying my fresh herb biscuit.
