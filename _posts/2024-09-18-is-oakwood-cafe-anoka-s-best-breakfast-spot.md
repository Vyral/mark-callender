[The Oakwood Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/oakwoodcafeanoka/) was great when it opened, but it’s even better than I remember. It opened last year in the historic co-op building and offers a unique dining experience focusing on breakfast and lunch. Now, they have many new items for sale, including more selection of baked goods, breakfast sandwiches, and coffee.

It has become my favorite breakfast spot in Anoka. I was here a few weeks ago and had an herb breakfast sandwich, which is one of the best breakfast sandwiches I’ve tasted in this area. Today, I came in for their herb sausage and a breakfast sandwich on a gluten-free egg, cheddar cheese, and herb biscuit they make fresh.

You’ll be surprised to be greeted by colorful and fragrant flowers as you enter Oakwood Cafe. This is because they share space with Floral, a charming flower shop in Hanover, which I will feature soon. In the meantime, I’ll be enjoying my fresh herb biscuit.
