There are six common mistakes that I see sellers make all the time. These six aren’t the only mistakes you could make, but they are at the top of my list.

**1\. Picking the wrong agent.** You want an agent who has experience listing homes, not one who just represents buyers. They’re totally different things.

**2\. Overpricing your home.** This could be No. 1; it happens all of the time in this market, and it’s a big mistake. Make sure you price your home right.

**3\. Not making simple repairs.** If you want to sell for top dollar, you need to make those simple, cosmetic repairs. This includes painting, replacing wallpaper, and even some flooring updates.

**4\. Neglecting to declutter.** I always say: Store, put, or throw away anything larger than a basketball. We do a couple of walk-throughs before taking pictures to make sure the home is decluttered and depersonalized.

**5\. Restricting access.** It’s easy to say that you’ll just require people to make appointments, but it doesn’t always work that way. The National Association of Realtors says that over 75% of agents and buyers who get denied an appointment request never come back to that home.

**6\. Getting too emotional.** I know it’s personal, but you need to look at selling your home as a business decision.

If you have questions about these top six mistakes or anything else related to real estate, feel free to give me a call. I’d love to talk with you.
