Today I’m pleased to be speaking with Jan Johnson, the owner of Jan Johnson Upholstery. I’ll ask her a few questions about her career, what she does, and how she helps her customers.&nbsp;

Jan’s been in the business since 1994 when she started out in Northeast Minneapolis. About four or five years ago, she moved her business to Ramsey, **and she’s loved the town ever since.** Jan got started by cleaning houses in her early 20’s, and she discovered that she loved working for herself. After doing some research, she decided to go into the upholstery business due to the problem solving and personal relationships required.&nbsp;

Jan focuses on residential furniture, but she does a little bit of commercial upholstery on the side. **She likes the personal contact she has with her clients and really cherishes working directly with people.&nbsp;**

If you need some upholstery work done, I couldn’t recommend Jan enough. Reach out to her at [(612) 824-7376](tel:612-824-7376) or email [jansupholstery@mail.com](mailto:jansupholstery@mail.com). As always, don’t hesitate to call or email me with any real estate questions. I look forward to hearing from you!
