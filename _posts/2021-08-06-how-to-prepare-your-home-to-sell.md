Many sellers have been calling and asking what they need to do to prepare their house for sale. I’ve discussed this on my blog before, but it’s worth doing it again because the main things I’m asked are how sellers can get the most money for their house and what should be prioritized. Here are the top three things you need to do to prepare your home for sale:

**1\. Price it correctly.** Even in a seller’s market, if you price over market value, you won’t get many showings or multiple offers. Statistics show that if you price your home about 10% to 15% under value, you’ll receive multiple offers, which will drive up the price. When we discuss selling your house, we need to talk about pricing, comparables, and what your home is worth in the current real estate market.

**2\. Stage it properly.** Stage your property both inside and out; we need to create curb appeal, declutter, ensure the furniture flows well in the home, and more.

**3\. Make sure your house is ready to be listed when it’s listed.** You can’t put your home on the market quickly, then afterward say you want new pictures of it (or something similar) because your home’s already on the market and being shown. No matter the quality or price of the home, I always have professional photos taken. The first thing people look at are the photos when they see your home on the MLS, so they’re a priority when preparing to list.

These are the top three things we discuss with those considering listing their homes. If you have any questions about preparing your home or concerning real estate in general, feel free to reach out via phone or text. We would love to help you.
