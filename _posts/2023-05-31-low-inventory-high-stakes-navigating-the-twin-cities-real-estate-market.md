Is the Twin Cities metro area still in a seller’s market? The short answer is yes. Lawrence Yun, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, acknowledges this.

**Inventory levels are still at historic lows, leading to multiple offers on many properties.** In fact, in the past few weeks, I've observed multiple offers on every property when working with my buyers. If you want your offer to get accepted in today’s market, having an experienced agent is crucial. To help you win, I'll discuss this topic further in another blog post, including how I successfully secured four buyer contracts under contract purchase agreements without the need to waive inspections.
