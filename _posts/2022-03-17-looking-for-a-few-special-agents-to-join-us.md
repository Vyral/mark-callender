We might have a small team here at the Callender Home Team, but we’re growing. Today I have some very exciting news to share: **We are hiring\!** **We’re currently looking for one or two new agents who want to join our mentorship program or a seasoned agent to join us as a full-time buyer’s agent.**

If you’re thinking about getting into the business, I’d love to talk to you about it. It’s an exciting industry, and our motto has always been, “We take care of our clients first, and the money follows.”&nbsp;

If you’re already an agent and you’re looking to up your production, I’d be happy to show you what we can offer.&nbsp;

**Whether you're a new agent or a seasoned one, our brokerage has the best training in the market.** I also work with a personal coach that you’ll have access to as well. We will supply you with leads, help you grow, and work together to build a strong and lasting business.

We build relationships that last, and we get a lot of repeat and referral business as a result. If you’re interested in getting into a business like this, please give us a call or send us an email to learn more about the opportunity.

If you have any questions or any interest in joining us, don’t hesitate to reach out today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
