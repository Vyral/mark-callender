Are you trying to help your buyers purchase a home? We have a big inventory shortage, and competition is high, so it’s likely you’ll find yourself in a multiple-offer situation. If you do, how can you stand out and win the home?&nbsp;

First, **ask the listing agent what the seller wants (besides a higher price).** Usually, listing agents will be candid about what their sellers need. If they just want the most money possible, there isn’t much you can do since you’re probably already offering as much as you can. However, if they want other things, there are a few strategies you can employ.&nbsp;

Have a flexible closing date, and see if the seller needs to stay in their home for a bit while shopping for a new one. Some sellers will want to close as soon as possible, while others will prefer a longer close so that they have more time to look for a new house.&nbsp;

Another thing you can do is have your loan officer give the listing agent a call. The listing agent wants to know your buyer won’t back out of the deal because of financial issues. If your lender vouches for you, your seller will have more confidence in your offer.&nbsp;

**Here are a few things your buyer can add to their offer:**

* Offer to pay any taxes at closing
* Offer to let the seller stay in their home while they shop for a new one
* Offer to pay broker fees
* Offer to help with moving expenses

Often, just by asking, you can stand out from the crowd and move to the top of your seller’s list.&nbsp;
