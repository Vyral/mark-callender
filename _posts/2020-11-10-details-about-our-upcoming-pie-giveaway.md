Here’s how to get your hands on a free, delicious pie for Thanksgiving.

Any way you slice it, we are incredibly thankful for your business and referrals, which continue to allow us to do what we do best. To say thanks, **we want to provide a dessert for your family’s Thanksgiving meal** this year. We’re teaming up with Hy-Vee to get you a free, delicious pie, and it’s really simple to get yours. All you have to do is send us an email with your name and address, and we will send you a certificate that you can use for a free pie at any Hy-Vee store. We need your response by November 20 because the coupon is only good for a limited time.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. In the meantime, we hope you have a happy and healthy Thanksgiving.
