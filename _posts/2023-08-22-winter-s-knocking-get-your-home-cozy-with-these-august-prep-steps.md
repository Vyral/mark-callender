Today, we'll discuss four essential tasks to complete in August that will pay off when winter arrives. Many individuals tend to postpone these tasks until winter arrives, leading to difficulties. It's wise to address these matters in advance. Here are a few things to do to winter-proof your home.

**1\. Tune up your snowblower**. Prepare your snowblower, or if you rely on a snow plow service, ensure you secure a reservation promptly, as they become extremely busy. In regions like Minnesota, snowfall can be unpredictable. Therefore, it's advisable to either maintain your snowblower or arrange for professional snowplowing.

**2\. Arrange for furnace check-ups.** Discovering that your furnace isn't functional during freezing temperatures is far from ideal. Prioritize scheduling a safety check to ensure efficient operation.

**3\. Make sure your home is efficient.** Given the soaring costs of gas and electricity, many individuals are opting for home energy audits. Local gas companies might offer low-cost or even free checks during specific months. This audit aims to enhance your home's energy efficiency.

**4\. Consider planting trees now for next year.** While autumn is a common tree-planting season, August is advantageous because it allows the tree to establish root systems before the cold sets in, promoting its survival.

Tackling these four tasks before winter approaches will make sure you enjoy the colder seasons. Enjoy your summer, but also begin preparations for the upcoming fall and winter months.
