There’s a great bakery in Anoka, Minnesota, that you might not know about. It’s called Crown Bakery, and I interviewed the owner, Maddie McCormick, to learn what they’re all about.

**Maddie, what made you decide to own a bakery?**

My business partner and I had been working at a bakery together, and we loved working with each other so much that we decided to run our own place.

**What made you buy this bakery?**

I worked here for about five years, and I loved every recipe they made here. I knew if I ever had the opportunity to buy it that I wouldn’t change anything. We’ve owned it for about a year and a half now.

**What makes this bakery unique?**

The recipes. They’re very traditional but still delicious. There’s a certain nostalgia they give people; they bring back memories.

**What’s your most popular item?**

Probably our Budapest roll. It tastes great, and it’s a lot of fun to make.

**You get super busy during the holidays, right?**

We do. The line usually goes out the door, and business has just gotten better recently.

If you’re ever in Anoka, don’t forget to stop by this amazing bakery. Of course, if you have any real estate questions, feel free to call or email me. I’d love to help.
