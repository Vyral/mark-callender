The spring market now starts in January. Are you ready? Here’s what you need to know.

Today’s market is more complicated than ever before: there are iBuyer programs, guaranteed offers, and many other things that complicate decision-making in the market. Today I’m here to simplify the process for you from start to finish.

Are you ready for the spring real estate market? I know that it’s only January, but in which month do you think that most people who are thinking of buying or selling homes will actually start their search?

If you’re like most people, you probably think that those searches happen in the spring, but not anymore—increasingly, people are starting their searches in January. **According to new research, January of 2018 was only 1% behind February for the most listing views on Realtor.com per month.**

What does this mean?

It means that **the busiest season in real estate has just begun.** Historically, the most popular month for looking at online listings was April, with January lagging behind In 2019. However, the home shopping season in many of the largest markets now begins in January. The winter slowdown naturally reduced the number of homes available, and the supply will increase as we get closer to spring.

But don’t wait until then to get started on your real estate goals—there will be more competition in the spring. If you wait until then to list, it might put you behind the curve. **Now is the time to jump into the market; buyers are looking for homes right now, so there’s no reason to wait.**

A senior economist at Realtor.com says that “\[…\] as shoppers modify their strategies for navigating in the housing market, it’s become more competitive due to rising prices and low inventory.”

The search for homes is starting earlier and earlier; **buyers are tired of competing with so many people over one house**. They’re also tired of paying way above the list price and losing their negotiation power.

The bottom line is that the new spring market for real estate is now underway. If you’re thinking of buying or selling, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’ll give you an advantage in this competitive market. We hope to hear from you soon\!
