Not all real estate agents are created equal. A startling 49% of agents in the United States in 2023 sold little to no homes, emphasizing the need for consumers to exercise caution. Amidst the noise and flashy content on social media, it's crucial to conduct due diligence before selecting a real estate professional. Let's explore why discernment is key in this industry.

While social media can make every agent appear to be a top producer, it's essential to distinguish between genuine professionals and those merely posing. Many dedicated agents showcase their accomplishments online, but it's equally important to be aware of the fakers and posers.

When dealing with your most significant asset, safety is paramount. **Opting for a full-time agent ensures they are committed to the real estate business and not juggling side hustles.** Your chosen agent should be devoted to either selling your property or helping you find the home of your dreams.

To guarantee you are in capable hands, **inquire about an agent's production.** Ask straightforward questions such as, "How many homes have you sold?" and "How long have you been in business?" These inquiries reveal the agent's track record and experience, ensuring they are well-equipped to handle your real estate needs.

Every brokerage maintains production reports for their agents. Don't hesitate to request this information, as it provides insights into an agent's performance and success over time. Responsible agents are open to sharing this data, allowing you to make an informed decision.

Beyond the basics, take the time to thoroughly interview potential agents. For buyers, schedule a consultation at their office, while sellers should invite agents for on-site visits. Prepare a set of questions to gauge their expertise, communication skills, and overall suitability for your specific requirements.

By following these tips, you can navigate through the noise and find a trustworthy professional who will genuinely prioritize your needs. If you have any questions, donâ€™t hesitate to call or send an email.
