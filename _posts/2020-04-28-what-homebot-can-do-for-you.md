<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s a quick rundown of everything Homebot can do for you.</em></p>

With the advent of the coronavirus outbreak and all the resulting stay-at-home orders, today’s market is more complicated than ever, and buyers and sellers have encountered a new range of challenges. The good news is that my team and I are still ready and able to carry out transactions using virtual technology and sanitizing measures to keep our clients safe.&nbsp;

Speaking of tools to help, today I’d like to discuss a highly recommended home valuation program that will help us help you: Homebot.&nbsp;

The Homebot program sends you an email once a month, but you can access it anytime, and there are plenty of other features it provides.&nbsp;
