Are you thinking about selling your home here in the Twin Cities?

You're invited to my Home Selling Workshop: How to Get Top Dollar in Uncertain Times on Wednesday, July 29th at 6:00 pm.

Get your free ticket to my workshop&nbsp;[**here**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/twin-cities-home-selling-workshop-how-to-get-top-dollar-in-uncertain-times-tickets-111703857244){: target="_blank"}.

It's a virtual, online event to stay safe.

I'm going to answer your biggest questions about selling your home and help you explore all your options.

Including:

* Is COVID-19 affecting prices?
* What if I can’t pay my mortgage?
* Can I get an instant offer?
* Can my home be sold safely?
* Are home prices dropping?
* Is now a good time to sell?
* Do I need to repair my home?
* Will my home pass inspection?
* What mistakes should I avoid?
* How do I get rid of my “stuff”?
* How do I attract buyers now?

You'll learn 3 ways to add thousands of dollars to your home sale in an uncertain market and what repairs to make (or avoid). You'll get a free neighborhood market report with a free listing price recommendation after you attend, too.

You can attend safely from your computer/phone/tablet. If you're thinking about selling your home, you need to attend this.&nbsp;

Call me at 612-961-9448 if you have questions or if you need an offer on your home right away.
