Today, we're delving into the exciting realm of buying new construction homes. As we kick off our spring parade, builders are showcasing their finest creations, presenting many options across different price ranges. **This spring parade is the perfect opportunity for prospective buyers to explore the offerings of various builders.** With each builder featuring unique options and price points, it's a fun and informative experience to survey the landscape and discover the perfect fit for your needs.

However, as you step into a builder's model and engage with their representatives, keep in mind that the agent you encounter doesn't represent you as a buyer. At this initial stage, they hold no fiduciary duties towards you, and there might not be a signed buyer contract. While they provide agency representation, it's essential to understand that their allegiance lies with the builder, not you.

This prompts a crucial question: Are your best interests being safeguarded? Without a contract with the builder's agent, the answer is likely no. **To ensure you have someone looking out for you, it's advisable to secure the services of a qualified agent with experience in new construction transactions.**
