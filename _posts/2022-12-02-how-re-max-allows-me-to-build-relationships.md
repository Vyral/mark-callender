As most of you probably know, my team is brokered by RE/MAX Realty. However, I’ve never explained why I work with them, what they do for me, and most importantly, how they help you.&nbsp;

The other day, I was approached by an agent from a competing brokerage. They asked me if I would ever consider leaving RE/MAX, and my answer was the same as it always was: **I don’t have plans to leave this brokerage ever.&nbsp;**

The truth is that a lot of other brokerages offer their agents alternative profit streams like stock options and one-time signing bonuses, but those things don’t translate into better service. On the other hand, RE/MAX has remained focused on putting their clients’ experiences first. Not only does this provide you with great service, but it helps agents like me maintain a sustainable, honest business.

For example, a lot of brokerages offer their agents massive marketing budgets, but that budget is only earmarked for the agent. That means none of that money is going towards selling your home. Instead, RE/MAX has a strong brand and advertising campaigns independent of any individual agent. **That means we can spend our marketing budget on selling your home instead of promoting ourselves.**&nbsp;

I’m a relationship-builder, so I need a brokerage that helps me maintain and grow these relationships. At the end of the day, this helps my business and helps you get the best deal possible. If you have questions about this, or would like to buy or sell a home, please call or email me. I’d love to speak with you\!
