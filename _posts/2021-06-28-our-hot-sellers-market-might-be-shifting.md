We’ve been in an incredibly strong seller’s market for a while now, but it seems we’re beginning to see a slight shift. **Mainly, recent data shows that a lot more inventory is coming onto the market, which is causing things to even out a bit.**

I checked the number of listings the day before I shot this video and found that, over a three-day period, there were 613 coming-soon listings and 634 active listings. On the day I shot the video, the number of coming-soon listings had jumped to 778, while the active listings had jumped to 1,625. Basically, the number of active listings nearly tripled within a single day. Additionally, there are 491 pending sales and 1,136 closed sales.

Needless to say, many sellers have decided that now’s the time to list. We could also be seeing a big change in the fall because buyers will have more homes to look at. This means that you’ll likely have much more competition from other sellers. Additionally, my agents are taking buyers to see multiple homes now—keep in mind that a month ago, most buyers only saw a single property before making an offer. **That’s how intense the competition was, but it seems like things are shifting now.**
