I want to talk today about why you should interview more than one agent when you sell your home. When you interview a Realtor, you’re going to find out a lot about them. How big is their brokerage, what is their brand like, and what kind of exposure would your home get?

One of the biggest questions I get is what my commission would be. I ask in return, “What’s more important: my commission or your net profit?” Almost everyone cares more about their net profit.

**Sometimes people ask if I’ll lower my commission** because they’ve talked to other agents who will. The issue here is with integrity. If I lower my commission for one client, I should lower my commission for every client. Otherwise, it’s just not fair. Not to mention, if I lowered my commission for my clients, how good of a negotiator would I be when I go to sell your house?

Trust is another big issue. I work with RE/MAX, one of the largest brokerages in the world. Everybody knows and trusts their brand name, which gives my clients more trust in me.

**You should also ask how an agent can help you in the interviews.** A lot of sellers want help preparing their house and making the transaction proceed smoothly. Those are all very legitimate concerns, and I do many things to make sure those concerns are addressed when you work with me.

I also hire a professional photographer, I bring on a staging consultant, and we have a checklist of over 160 things that we do for each seller, so I can show you the value I bring to my clients.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about selling your home or interviewing agents, I would love to help. Just call or email me. I look forward to hearing from you.
