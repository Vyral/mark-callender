Continuing my series on highlighting great local businesses, I am excited to feature [Willy’s on the Water](https://www.willymccoys.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} today! I was fortunate enough to get to talk to the owner, Korey Bannerman, about the restaurant and the awesome things coming up once the weather warms up.&nbsp;

First, Korey got started in the restaurant business when he was working in real estate. Now he owns eight restaurants, all of which have been a great success. Willy’s on the Water is his newest one, which opened up right before Thanksgiving.&nbsp;

**One of the best advantages of this restaurant is the location.** The building is right on the water and has an amazing view. Plus, they have a big patio and lots of docks, so this place will be booming in the summer. Lastly, Korey is connected with the pontoon builders nearby, and great opportunities are coming from that.&nbsp;

**I highly recommend that you check out Willy’s on the Water, especially once the weather warms up.** In the meantime, if you have any questions about this or real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out! You can call or email me anytime.
