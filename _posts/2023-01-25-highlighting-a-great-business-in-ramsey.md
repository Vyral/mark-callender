Today I am excited to highlight a local business that many people in our area might not even know about, and that is [Goes Around Tire Transport](https://www.goesaroundtiretransport.com/). To learn more about it, I had the privilege of meeting with the owner, Mike Flynn.&nbsp;

**Mike has been in business for almost five years and has around 200 clients in the Twin Cities area.** He goes to those locations and picks up their discarded tires to bring them to a recycling facility so they’re disposed of properly. They have their busier seasons, especially when it snows, as that’s when many people decide to get new tires—Mike says his business can increase by 30% overnight when snow falls

**{% include pullquote.html %}**

He also says that his customers love that he truly cares for them. **Everyone in his business treats each customer the same no matter how much they produce.** They also customize their pickups based on people’s needs.&nbsp;

Goes Around Tire Transport consists of four trucks and four employees. They work all year, but are especially busy around this time of year, and have lately needed to put in at least 60 hours per week just to keep up. Mike truly enjoys working with people, and he says he has experienced some powerful things just by being kind to them.&nbsp;

If you have any questions, you can contact Mike by visiting his website. Also, you can always contact me with any of your real estate needs. Call or email me anytime!
