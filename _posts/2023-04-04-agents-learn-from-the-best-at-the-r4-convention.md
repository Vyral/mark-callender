I recently attended a convention in Las Vegas, the RE/MAX R4 Convention, which was an international convention. It took place at the MGM Grand Hotel, and it was an impressive venue with a great turnout.&nbsp;

**RE/MAX celebrated its 50th anniversary, and the speakers were amazing.** The convention center was filled and the speakers were unbelievably good. When you work with RE/MAX, your brand is strong, and **no one sells more real estate than RE/MAX.&nbsp;**

The convention also featured a lot of charity work and donations, which was amazing to see. I am pleased to be with RE/MAX, which is why I have stayed with them for 20 years and I'm not going anywhere.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about the event or anything else related to real estate, call or email me. Iâ€™m always happy to help!
