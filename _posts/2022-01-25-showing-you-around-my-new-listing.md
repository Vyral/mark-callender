Today I’m bringing you up to Princeton, Minnesota, to show you one of my new listings. It’s a one-level, 1,800 square foot home with three beds and two baths. It sits on 10 acres of land with a detached two-car garage, a 40 by 80 outbuilding, and another garage in the back. This is a beautiful property, so I wanted to give you a look.
