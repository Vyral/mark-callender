A home warranty can either be purchased by a homebuyer or by a seller on behalf of the buyer. No matter what your situation, it’s important to know about the different kinds of warranty companies and which is best.

**Home warranties are used to cover the mechanical systems in your home, including appliances, furnaces, and the other mechanisms that run your home.** It could also include plumbing and electrical. However, it does not cover your roof, your siding, etc. Those things are covered by insurance. You can purchase one at any time as long as you’re a homeowner.

There is a warranty company that we feel is better than the rest. They will actually cover old systems that are in working condition. It doesn’t matter that they're old. Reach out to us to learn more.

If you have any questions about home warranties or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
