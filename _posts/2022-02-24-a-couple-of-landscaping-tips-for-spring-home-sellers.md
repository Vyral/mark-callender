Spring is nearly here, and if you’re thinking about selling your Minnesota home this spring, now is the time to prepare.

Curb appeal is a great place to start. If you are planning to have any landscaping done this year, it’s also time to decide whether you’re going to do it yourself or hire a contractor. To be honest with you, landscapers are already getting booked out, so **if you plan on hiring someone, you need to do it sooner rather than later.** Try to have them out to your property by the end of March. On the other hand, if you do it yourself, you’ll have a little more time. Taking some time to spruce up your yard is a great way to attract buyers.

Keep in mind that our inventory shortage has also carried over to the landscaping industry. They don’t have enough shrubs, grass, seeds, fertilizer, or trees to meet the current demand. Last year, we saw quite a decline in landscaping, and those products go quickly in the spring when everyone decides to list.

As for the inside of your home, the two things I would emphasize are flooring and paint. **A small investment could bring a big return**, especially if you pair it with some nice outdoor landscaping.

If you have any questions for me about landscaping, need recommendations for local landscapers, or would like more tips on getting your home ready for sale, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
