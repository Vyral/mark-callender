I have a recommendation for you today. **If you have a repair or need a handyman to provide a service in your home, I want you to call me first.** I’m not only a real estate agent. I’m also here to provide you with lifetime service on your home.&nbsp;

I have a book that contains all of the trusted contractors that I’ve worked with over the years. I’ve personally worked with these people, and I trust their services and their prices.

I’d be happy to send you my list today. **If you’d like a copy, just reach out via phone or email.** No matter what you need done in or around your home, I can help.

Finally, I have one request. My trusted plumber has recently retired, and I’m looking for another to add to my list. If you know of a local plumber who does great work, please reach out.

If you have any other real estate-related questions for me, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
