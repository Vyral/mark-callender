Today we’re going to talk about buyer fatigue and buyer perseverance and how each is playing a role in today’s market.

**As we all know, there are about half as many available homes for sale as there were last year.** According to the National Association of Realtors, there have only been about 5.1 million new construction homes put on the market in the past 10 years. The decade prior saw 21 million new homes being built.

This has resulted in people not being able to move up into their dream homes. **Developers and builders are really going to have to get these new developments going to get the market moving a little bit.** We’re at a bit of a standstill right now.

There’s good news from the last few weeks to share for the frustrated buyers out there. I’ve had five buyer contracts turn into accepted offers over the last week. It hasn’t been an easy road, but with the knowledge that my team has, we’re able to overcome almost any obstacle.&nbsp;

We can find ways to get the job done in this competitive home-buying market. **I understand the natural fatigue that comes with being a buyer today, but we will help you persevere and win.**

If you have any questions for me about buying a home or real estate in general, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
