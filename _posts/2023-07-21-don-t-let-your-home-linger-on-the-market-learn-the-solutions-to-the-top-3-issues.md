Are you struggling to sell your home? If you’re a homeowner who is having difficulty selling, know that you’re not alone. Fortunately, there are ways to combat this issue, and we’re here today to talk about them. I recently spoke with a seller who had to take their home off the market because it had been sitting there with no offers for three months. I had a discussion with them about some of the reasons why that was happening. Here are the top three reasons why your home may not be selling and what to do about them:&nbsp;

**1\. Pricing problems.** This is a very common issue, as many homeowners price their homes too high in hopes that it will leave room for them to negotiate down. However, this may end up turning buyers away and losing you money in the end. Today’s buyers are getting smarter, so listen to the feedback you’re getting in open houses, as you may find the common problem is the price. In most cases, you need to lower your price a little, and the right agent can help you do that appropriately based on comparable homes.

**2\. Product problems.** Sometimes, there may be a problem with your home. Again, listen to what people say at your open houses and respond to the feedback. Maybe there are renovations or updates you need to make. However, sometimes it can be as simple as decluttering to show that the home has more space. Also, a common problem is staging. The correct staging (including curb appeal, decorations, paint, and much more) will make a huge difference. ​​​​​​

**3\. Marketing problems.** The truth is that you won’t sell your home if buyers don’t even hear about it. Make sure you work with an agent who has a top-notch marketing plan. The majority of consumers start their home search by looking online, so make sure you have an excellent listing. Also, work with someone who knows how to get your listing seen by the most people possible, including through social media and even virtual open houses.&nbsp;

Know that you’re not the first person to run into one or more of these three problems. They have stopped many sellers in the past, but they don’t have to stop you!
