By now, you’ve probably heard that Zillow has stopped buying homes as part of their Zillow Offers program. Some of these guaranteed offers you’ve been hearing about are going away. They lost a lot of money on this venture, which brings me to the Zestimate.

I’m sure you’ve seen your home’s Zestimate or the Zestimate of a house you’ve been interested in. I've said this before, but **I trust these Zesitmates as much as I trust gas station sushi.**

If you really want to know what your home is worth in today’s market, you need to rely on a trusted real estate professional. Even a full-blown appraisal is just an opinion of value. As agents, we try to make our estimates as close to market value as we can.

**When you hire me, I’ll give you an honest and true opinion of what your home is worth based on market conditions today.** I don’t over inflate values just to get listings. Honesty is my strategy.

We have a program that can help you keep track of your home’s value and more. **It’s called Homebot, and it’s a free service that offers you income insights and tips to save money and build wealth in your home.** It’s a great way to keep track of your home’s value based on all the latest data, and there are a ton of helpful tools to help homeowners save money. Reach out to me today to get more information about Homebot and to sign up.

If you have questions about iBuyers, Homebot, or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I would love to hear from you soon.
