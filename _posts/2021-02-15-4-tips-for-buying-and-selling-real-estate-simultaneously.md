Here are four tips for juggling buying and selling a home.

There are four key steps to juggling a home sale and a home purchase at the same time:

**1\. Sit down and make a plan.** We can help find out what your goals are, ease your stress about the process, and get a game plan in place so there are no surprises along the way.

**2\. Get approved.** We’ll have you reach out to a lender to get approved for a mortgage so you know exactly what you can afford and your offers will look more attractive to home sellers.&nbsp;

**3\. Write a clause into your listing.** The clause will state “The sale is subject to the seller finding a home of their choice and a successful closing.” It protects you from selling fast and ending up homeless because you can’t find a new home. Buyers in this hot market are okay with a clause like this if it means they can get your home under contract.&nbsp;

**4\. Start looking for homes.** When we begin our search right away, we can make a solid offer while your home is under contract and let the agent who is selling the home know that we’re ready to close.

If you have any questions about buying a home, selling a home, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
