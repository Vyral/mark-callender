<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Working with an iBuyer makes a lot of sense for some and no sense for others. Here’s how to determine whether it’s a good option for you.</em></p>

Today’s market is more complicated than ever before. There are guaranteed offer programs, iBuyer programs, and more that are complicating the market today. We’re here to simplify the process from start to finish on the Mark Callender Home Team.

Last time, [we began our discussion](https://callenderhometeamjournal.com/to-sell-or-not-to-sell-to-an-ibuyer.html){: target="_blank"} on iBuyers. This time, we’re focusing on the pros and cons of the iBuyer process. **Here’s an outline of the discussion, with timestamps so that you can skip ahead to the section(s) that interest you most:**

1:05- The No. 1 benefit of using an iBuyer&nbsp;

2:05- Why you won’t have to worry about repairs

2:40- Why an iBuyer’s offer will never fall through

3:00- How you get the flexibility of timing with an iBuyer

4:05- The No. 1 disadvantage of selling to an iBuyer

4:35- Why you’ll still have to pay for repairs to your home

5:10- The cost of convenience as a home seller

6:10- The question you need to ask yourself before choosing your home-selling route

7:10- Wrapping things up and a future experiment I have in the works

If you have questions about iBuyers or anything I discussed today, feel free to give me a call or send an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
