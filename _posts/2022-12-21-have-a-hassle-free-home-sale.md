How do you get your home ready for the market? If you plan to sell your property in the next few weeks or months, here are six tips to help you prepare your home for the market:

**1\. Start decluttering right away.** If you haven't touched an item in a year or more, I recommend getting rid of it. Once you start reducing things in your home, it will alleviate some of your stress.&nbsp;

**2\. Make sure you have all the necessary permits for your home improvements.** I guarantee that when the time comes for you to sell your house, you’ll be required to disclose those permits to the buyer. You won’t save money by trying to get around getting the permits—instead, it will only result in more problems later on.&nbsp;

**3\. Remove family heirlooms such as light fixtures or mirrors.** Hide these things or store them somewhere else because when we take pictures of your property, we don’t want these things to be seen in the photos. You can replace them with something that you’re willing to leave in the house.

**4\. Get your pictures ahead of time.** Take pictures ahead of time so you can have the best possible photos of your home. If you’re not sure when to list, my team can take photos during spring or summer to show your property in full bloom. Then you’ll also have photos prepared if you decide to sell during the winter.&nbsp;

**5\. Hire a real estate agent.** This is one of the best tips I can share with you. If your agent is with an independent or smaller brokerage, they may not offer legal support, marketing, and other helpful services. The bigger brands typically offer more support to their agents to get your home sold for the top dollar. Also, you can continue to rely on my services to help you successfully sell your home.&nbsp;

**6\. Don’t list based on an online valuation.** If you want to sell and need to figure out the price of your home, don't look at online valuations on websites like Zillow or Realtor.com. These are automated and don’t always give accurate results. Remember that every market and city is different, so make sure you get a professional to see your property in person to come up with a reliable estimate.&nbsp;
