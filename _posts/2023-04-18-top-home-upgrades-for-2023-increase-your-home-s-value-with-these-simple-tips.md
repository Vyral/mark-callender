If you're planning to upgrade your home to increase its value, here are the top upgrades for 2023:

**1\. Customized cabinets.** For your kitchen upgrade, consider customizing and replacing your cabinets for top dollar.

**2\. Smart home technology.** Install a system for controlling lights, garage doors, and security systems.

**3\. Garbage disposals.** In Minnesota, having a garbage disposal is expected, so consider adding or upgrading one in your kitchen.

**4\. Professional sound systems.** Install a sound system in your media or living room for added value.

**5\. Pot fillers.** Adding a pot filler to your kitchen for filling pots of water is an inexpensive upgrade that can add value to your home.

You might want to consider getting rid of two items: jetted tubs and walk-in showers. Instead, install a nice soaker tub and ensure that you have at least one bathtub in the home for young families.
