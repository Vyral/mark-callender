<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Is it time to move to a single-story home?</em></p>

Once the kids leave the nest, you may be wondering what to do with all the extra space in your house. Chances are that you don’t need four bedrooms anymore, so it may be a great time to sell your property and downsize. You’ve likely gained some significant equity in your property, so **making a move while demand for your current home is high could be the best step for you right now.** The dilemma, though, is where to go next?

A big concern for many homeowners who are ready to sell is finding a new home to move into, given today’s lack of inventory. However, there is some good news: The number of single-family, one-story homes being built is on the rise, improving your odds of finding a home that’s right for your changing needs. One of your options is a single-level detached townhome or villa, which are becoming really popular with buyers, prompting builders to build them more often. 

If you’re still not sure about buying a single-family home, [an article from HomeTalk](https://www.hometalk.com/13105365/5-easy-steps-to-downsize){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} covers several advantages of switching from two floors to one:

**1. Energy efficiency.** It’s easier to heat and cool a single-story house than it is to regulate the temperature in a multi-story home. Most single-stories only need one heating/cooling unit, which can lead to significant savings.
**2.Easier maintenance.** Doing a general cleaning in a single-story home requires less effort, and the areas you need to clean are more accessible. Better upkeep helps improve the overall value of your home.
**3. Accessible to everyone.** Single-stories can be accessed by anyone, whether they’re young or old.&nbsp;
**4. They’re easy to sell.** Their accessibility makes for good resale potential when it comes time to sell.
**5. They’re in high demand**, which also contributes to their being easy to sell.

The bottom line is that there are a lot of benefits to moving into a one-level home. If you’re thinking about downsizing, reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you more about the benefits of doing so, as well as what the home you’re selling may be worth on the market.
