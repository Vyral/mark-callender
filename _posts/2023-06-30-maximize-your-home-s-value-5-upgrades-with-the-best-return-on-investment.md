What are the best home improvements you can make for a high return on investment? Today, I’ll share the five best upgrades you can make in the Twin Cities Metro area.&nbsp;

The first is flooring replacement, which we have discussed before. It offers one of the highest returns on investment. The average cost ranges from $3,500 to $13,500, depending on the home's size and the quality of the update. **On average, this update can increase your home's value by $21,000.**

The second update is landscaping, with an average cost between $1,000 and $1,500, and an average value increase of $31,140 to $43,140.

The third-best upgrade is interior paint, encompassing the entire house, including walls, ceilings, and trim. The average cost falls between $5,500 and $10,500, while the average value increase amounts to $15,500.

Roof replacement is the fourth update, which surprised me with its significant impact on home value. The average cost ranges from $9,000 to $23,500, while the average value increase is an impressive $61,920. This translates to a return on investment exceeding 15%, well above the commonly assumed 10%.

The fifth update is a kitchen refresh, involving updates to finishes such as repainting cabinets, retaining some cabinets, installing granite or quartz countertops, and updating fixtures. The average cost for this update is $14,000 to $17,000, while the average value increase is $58,035. **It is worth noting that kitchen and bathroom updates are typically the most expensive but yield the highest average return on investment.**
