Today I am excited to finally offer you my new buying and selling guides, which can be mailed to you directly. We just got them in, hot off the press, and they can be shipped to you immediately. We also have PDF copies available to send to you via email.&nbsp;

**[The buying guide](https://www.simplifyingthemarket.com/en/buyers/?a=217635-692cc4072008c625b870c7a565ab356f){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} lets you know what is happening in today’s market.** It’ll tell you all about the things you should be doing in terms of lenders and loans, as well as what you should be looking for in a home. It’s 25 pages of great information.

**[The selling guide](https://www.simplifyingthemarket.com/en/sellers/?a=217635-692cc4072008c625b870c7a565ab356f){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} has a lot of great details on how to prepare your home for sale.** It lists the things you should do and think about, as well as information on how to get a good return on your investment. Many people believe they need to drop a ton of money into their house before listing it, but just paint and new flooring go a long way. It’s this sort of wisdom that you can expect from the seller’s guide.

If you are interested in these guides and would like to see them, or if you are thinking about buying or selling a home soon, please call or email me. I’d love to help you out.
