Today, I'm joining you from the charming city of Anoka, often dubbed the Halloween Capital of the World. I find myself standing in front of a building adorned with a mural that proudly represents this unique title.

While I won't be delving into real estate today, **I am excited to share with you the incredible Halloween events that Anoka hosts.** Among the many festivities, they have the renowned Grand Day Parade, a 1.5-mile spectacle that lasts around three hours, give or take. It's a sight to behold, and Anoka certainly knows how to put on a show.

The city also boasts an outdoor tent party, a spine-tingling zombie crawl, a lively pub crawl, and captivating ghost tours and walks. The Halloween spirit is alive and thriving in Anoka, and I wanted to take a moment to give you a sneak peek into their delightful celebrations.

I'm currently stationed on Main Street, close to where the parade kicks off. As I mentioned, it spans a mile and a half and offers an experience lasting between three to 3.5 hours. However, it's the pre-parade events and the Halloween celebrations that truly set Anoka apart. I strongly encourage you to explore the numerous activities they have to offer.

**Anoka is not only known for its Halloween festivities but also for being a great place to live.** Since the challenging times of the Great Recession in 2008, people have flocked here to restore and rejuvenate the charming old homes. The city now thrives with an array of restaurants, bars, antique shops, and a vibrant community.
