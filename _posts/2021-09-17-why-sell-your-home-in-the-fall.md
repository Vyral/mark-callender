Even with more homes coming on the market lately, it remains a fantastic time to sell. This year, any time of the year has been a good time. If you price right and prepare correctly, you’ll have a successful sale.

**In the past, fall hasn’t been the best time to sell.** However, this year there are still plenty of motivated buyers out there. They’re ready to make offers and ready to move.&nbsp;

**Even if you don’t list until the holidays, the serious buyers will still be out there.** Some people think holiday decorations are a deterrent for buyers, but that’s actually not true. They help in some cases.&nbsp;

If you’re looking to sell your home this year, it’s time to get started on the process so you can get it sold for a great price before inventory picks up come January.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me about selling your home or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
