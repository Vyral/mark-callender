*To win in this market, these are the things you need to be doing.*

Right now, most agents are talking about guaranteed offers, home preparation tips, etc., and while those are all important things to know about, one key aspect is sometimes getting left out of the conversation: buyer strategies.

In the last month, I was able to help a homebuyer win out against 16 other offers. **Here are some strategies that can increase your odds of winning in this competitive market:**

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>1.</b>     Educate your buyers and set expectations before you look at properties.

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>2.</b>     Have a conversation with the listing agent about terms and price.

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>3.</b>     Consider an appraisal bridge.&nbsp;

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>4.</b>     Have your loan officer call the listing agent.

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>5.</b>     DON’T write love letters about the home. It can turn some buyers off and create potential legal issues.

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"><b>6.</b>     Put your best offer in right away.

If you have any questions for me about helping buyers in this market or the real estate business in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
