What are the most important updates to make to your home before you sell? Preparing your house properly will help achieve a quicker closing and net you more money. I highly recommend doing two things:

* **Paint.** This may surprise you, but it’s a critical step to remember. Painting makes the home smell like updates have been made, and it camouflages defects like nail holes and scrapes. Actually, I suggest painting over any other upgrades you make (such as fixing cabinets). To appeal to the most buyers possible, you need to choose the right color.

Unless you’re an interior decorator, reach out to your real estate agent or a local paint store such as Sherwin-Williams to help you. They’ll know what the most popular colors are right now and what buyers want to see.&nbsp;

* **Flooring.** Replacing carpet or vinyl can be a little expensive, but the return on investment is often 100%, possibly even more. Buyers feel that if it is already done, they don’t have to do it themselves and assume another expense. They will be glad to avoid the work and move right into their new house, which is what most buyers are looking for today.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about preparing your property for sale or real estate in general, please reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&nbsp;
