<p style="text-align: center;"><em>It’s easy to get upset if you receive a lowball offer on your home. I’m offering suggestions on how to handle this situation.</em></p>

If someone writes you a lowball offer for your home, how should you handle it? **Lowball offers in this market are becoming rarer.** If you receive one, your house is probably overpriced; we’re in a seller’s market right now.&nbsp;

Receiving a lowball offer can be hurtful, disappointing, disheartening, and maybe even offensive. Real estate agents know all the negative yet understandable things you want us to pass on to the buyers who sent such a disrespectful offer. It’s common for both sellers and their agents to get so wrapped up in their righteous indignation that they refuse all future communication from those buyers. However, the only winner in that situation is the seller’s pride, which has a monetary value of exactly zero. Don’t let your anger get the best of you.

I primarily encourage you to always be gracious and respond with a counteroffer. The fact that someone admired your property enough to take the time to write an official offer is a promising start. There are various reasons why some buyers choose to submit a lowball offer. Some want to test your willingness to negotiate, some sellers have been known to accept a lowball offer for personal reasons, the buyer may feel your home is overpriced, etc.&nbsp;

It’s not the buyer’s job to know the value of your house; most buyers don’t sit and study the market as Realtors do. It’s the real estate agent’s job to educate buyers about home values. **Negotiation is how selling homes works.** Negotiating an offer is sometimes the most fun agents have on a workday. Don’t let too much emotion get to you during a real estate transaction, it’s never helpful.

If you’re looking for a strong negotiator to be on your side during a real estate transaction or you have any questions, please reach out to me via phone or email. I have 18 years of real estate experience and will work hard for you. I look forward to speaking with you.
