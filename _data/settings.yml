  about_markdown: |
    Hello, my name is Mark Callender and I am a licensed real estate agent with RE/MAX Results. Because I have been helping families buy and sell their homes for more than 18 years, I am now helping their children to buy their first homes and their parents to downsize. No matter the direction you’re moving, my goal is to make the process as calm and enjoyable as it can be.

    I have always loved houses, architecture and people, so real estate is a natural career for me. In the 1990s, I worked as an appraiser, which is a tremendously handy skill to bring to real estate sales. Whether you’re selling or buying, my ability to create an accurate Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) ensures the best price possible for you.
